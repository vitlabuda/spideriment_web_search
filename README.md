# THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED

Due to its limited flexibility and certain poor design decisions, the original
_Spideriment_ project has been abandoned and is no longer maintained. This
applies to all the components of this project:
[Spideriment](https://github.com/vitlabuda/spideriment),
[Spideriment Search Server](https://github.com/vitlabuda/spideriment_search_server)
and [Spideriment Web Search](https://github.com/vitlabuda/spideriment_web_search).

**However, the project has been rewritten from scratch as a whole, with many
improvements in terms of the components' software design and architecture,
features, configuration options, flexibility, extensibility and scalability:**
- **[Spideriment-NG](https://github.com/vitlabuda/spideriment-ng)**
- **[Spideriment-NG Search](https://github.com/vitlabuda/spideriment-ng-search)**
- **[Spideriment-NG Docker](https://github.com/vitlabuda/spideriment-ng-docker)**

This repository's original _README_ file has been renamed to
[README-old.md](README-old.md).
